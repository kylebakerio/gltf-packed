# using meshopt with aframe
Here's a demo for using meshopt with aframe!

Component design inspired by this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65367877/how-do-i-get-a-gltfpack-processed-model-to-appear-in-a-frame

Note that gltfpack is software you install locally. See [here](https://meshoptimizer.org/gltf/) for install instructions

Note that while you can install with npm, you will be missing critical features, so it's worth it installing it "properly".
